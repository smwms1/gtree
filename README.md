# gtree

GTREE is designed to be a simple family tree program, created by the lack of
existing 'simple' programs. It has a data format that can easily be edited by
hand, and a simple command-line interface. It is currently not scriptable, but
I could add such functionality in the future (I am not currently planning to do
so, though).

It is designed to be a 'run-anywhere' program; it provides support for:
- **Windows** Vista and later
- **Mac OS X** Snow Leopard (10.6) and later

It will also provide support for all UNIX operating systems that have a version
of Python of **3.7** or later.
